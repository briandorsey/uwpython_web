<b>Course objectives:</b> 
This course emphasizes distributed programs and web applications - how they work and how to program them in Python. Students will explore the underlying principles and their expression in Python libraries. Students will learn contrasting approaches in creating applications: programming with the low-level libraries versus using highly integrated frameworks. All topics will be presented with a focus on solving real problems with simple, pragmatic code.
</p>

<p>
<b>Prerequisites:</b> 
Students should have successfully completed 
<a href="http://staff.washington.edu/jon/python-course/"><b>Programmming in Python</b></a> or have an equivalent level of experience. Contact the instructor prior to registering if not in the certificate program.

</p>

<p>
<b>Textbooks:</b> Various online sources will be used.
</p>

<p>
<b>Instructor:</b> <a href="http://briandorsey.info">
Brian Dorsey</a>.
<BR/>Brian Dorsey is a database and Python developer with over 10 years of
experience using Python professionally. He currently works at Vulcan Inc.,
developing command line tools, simple web applications, Windows services,
HTTP/JSON APIs and the occasional iPhone prototype. He is excited about
information, databases, user experience, testing and glue code. Brian is a
co-organizer of the Seattle Python Interest Group (www.seapig.org) and has
given several talks and tutorials at conferences and user groups.
</p>

<p>
<b>Technology Requirements:</b> Students must have access to a
computer for their assignments and projects, where they can install
software (the course does not provide a computer laboratory).  It is
recommended that students have a portable computer to bring to
class. Internet access will be provided at classes.
</p>

<p>
<b>Assessment criteria:</b> The course is graded Pass/Fail, based on
satisfactory completion of required programming assignments and
classroom presentations.  Attendance is required; more than two
unexcused absences will result in a Fail.
</p>

<p>
<b>Disability accommodation:</b> The University of Washington is
committed to providing access and reasonable accommodation in its
services, programs, activities, education and employment for
individuals with disabilities. For information or to request
disability accommodation contact: Disability Services Office:
206.543.6450/V, 206.543.6452/TTY, 206.685.7264 (FAX), or e-mail at

<p>
Assignments may be completed in groups of 1-3 people. Students are encouraged to actively consult each other and share any relevant reference and support material. However, all code submitted for assignments must be completely written by each group.
